<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가</h2>
    <p>WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) is the first web browser[1] and web page editor.[3] It was discontinued in 1994. It was the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.
The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993.[4][5] Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.[6] 
To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web.[7]</p>
